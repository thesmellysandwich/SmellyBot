# SmellyBot
You can be lazy like Smelly!

# Instructions
Start by downloading the files from the repository. You can do this right off the website or through terminal using gitclone and the repository URL. Note, you will need the RPG for this program  to work.

You will need the lastest stable version of python3 and pip3.
You can choose to create a virtual environment or install the libraires directly to you local python3 directory.

# Install  the required libraries with:
pip3 install pyautogui\
pip3 install stringcolor

Once these libraries are installed open a terminal window and go to the main directory for smellybot.
type <ins>python3 smellybot.py</ins>

Follow the instructions in terminal. You will need to choose one or two firing points. Once each countdown begins station you mouse where you want to shoot. Make sure you are in the position you want to camp.
Once you have the mouse positioned where you want in game you can alt + tab back to the terminal. Do not move your mouse until the co-ordinates are set.

# Recommendations
- Save your points so you can upgrade in bulk. You will need to alt + tab to terminal and spam control + c to exit the proram. Once upgraded you will have to return to you camp point and restart the program.
- You will need to babysit the program a bit, in the event you are moved from position or killed. If killed when you revive you will need to reselect your RPG.
- Make sure you have your RPG selected before running the program.
